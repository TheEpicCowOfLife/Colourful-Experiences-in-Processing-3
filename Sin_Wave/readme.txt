One of my first processing sketches.
Essentially every dot goes up and down according to a sin wave. The nth dot has a period proportional to 1/(n+10).
This is all that is needed to produce some pretty cool-looking motion, as you reach simple fractions of the cycle.
I.e. many things line up at 1/2 the cycle, 1/3 the cycle, 2/3 the cycle, etc.
